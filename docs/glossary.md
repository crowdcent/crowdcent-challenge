This glossary provides definitions for key terms used in the CrowdCent Challenge, organized alphabetically.

!!! warning "Challenge-Specific Columns"
    The exact feature names, target column names (e.g., `target_1M`, `target_10d`), and required prediction column names (e.g., `pred_1M`, `pred_10d`) can vary significantly from one challenge to another. 
    **Always refer to the specific rules and data description for the challenge you are participating in.** 
    The examples provided in this documentation are illustrative and may not apply to all challenges.

## Terminology

#### Categorical Features
Features representing discrete categories, typically obfuscated and named like `categorical_N` (where N is a number). These features contain integer values representing different categories.

#### Challenge
A top-level competition (e.g., "Crypto Ranking") focused on a specific prediction task. A challenge has:

- A unique slug (identifier in URLs)
- A name and description
- Start and end dates
- Associated training datasets and inference periods

#### Features
Data attributes used for prediction. In CrowdCent challenges, features may include:

**NLP Features**
- Generated by processing text data (e.g., analyst's investment write-up)
- Include embeddings related to different aspects (e.g., catalysts, financials, management)
- Named like `nlp_groupname_N` (e.g., `nlp_catalyst_0`, `nlp_financials_15`)
- Contain numerical values representing elements of embedding vectors

**Point-in-Time Features**
- Based on market conditions, fundamental data, or other factors known at a specific point in time
- Obfuscated and named like `fundamental_N`, `market_N`, etc.
- Contain numerical values

#### Fundamental Features
Features derived from fundamental data related to the investment idea, typically obfuscated and named like `fundamental_N` (where N is a number).

#### Identifier (`id`)
A unique numerical identifier assigned to each record in the dataset. The `id` is obfuscated and does not directly reveal the underlying security or analyst.

#### Inference Data
Periodic releases of new data for which you will make predictions. Each inference data period has:

- A release date
- A submission deadline
- A Parquet file containing features (but not targets) for inference

#### Market Features
Features derived from market conditions at the time the investment idea was submitted, typically obfuscated and named like `market_N` (where N is a number).

#### NLP Features
Features generated by processing text data, named like `nlp_groupname_N` (e.g., `nlp_catalyst_0`). These contain numerical values representing elements of embedding vectors.

#### Parquet
The file format used for all datasets in the CrowdCent Challenge. Parquet is a columnar storage file format optimized for analytical processing.

#### Prediction Target
The values you aim to predict. Typically these are return values for different time horizons. Common prediction targets include:

- `pred_1M`: Predicted return after 1 month
- `pred_3M`: Predicted return after 3 months
- `pred_6M`: Predicted return after 6 months
- `pred_9M`: Predicted return after 9 months
- `pred_12M`: Predicted return after 12 months

#### Submission
Your predictions for an inference data period. Submissions must be in Parquet format with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier matching the inference data |
| `pred_1M` | Predicted 1-month return |
| `pred_3M` | Predicted 3-month return |
| `pred_6M` | Predicted 6-month return |
| `pred_9M` | Predicted 9-month return |
| `pred_12M` | Predicted 12-month return |

All prediction columns must contain numeric values (float or integer). Missing values are not allowed.

#### Target
The ground truth values in training data that your model aims to predict. Targets are typically labeled as `target_1M`, `target_3M`, etc., corresponding to returns over different time horizons.

#### Training Dataset
Labeled data used for building your models. Each training dataset has:

- A version (e.g., "1.0", "2.1")
- Feature and target descriptions
- A Parquet file containing features and ground truth labels

Training datasets may be updated with new versions over time, but only one version is marked as "latest" at any time.

## Example Data Formats

The following examples illustrate what the data formats look like. The values are entirely fictional and intended only to demonstrate the format.
